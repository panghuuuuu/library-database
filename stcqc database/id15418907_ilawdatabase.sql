Cheesecloth is said to be used in cheesemaking wherein they remove the whey in cheese curds. For this to be effective, it is required to use other filtering mediums. Sand is another source of water filter because it is said that microorganisms cling to the surface of the sand particles inside the water. Iodine kills other microorganisms except toxic chemicals and other types of pollution.\r\n\r\nFor this experiment, the researchers gathered materials and prepared three set-ups. Set-up A used no filter, set-up B used Iodine, and set-up C used both the cheesecloth and sand. After conducting the experiment, Set-up A obtained the pH level of 8 which indicated that the water was alkaline, set-up B obtained the mean of 7.33 and set-up C gained a pH level of 7 which indicated that the water was neutral. We concluded that set-up C was more effective because it obtained the pH level of 7.', 'Filter, Chemistry, Iodine, Cheesecloth, Sand, pH level, Water, Science, Filtration System, System, Microorganism, Water Filter, Filtrate, Separation Technique, h2o, scientific method, setup, environment, fluid', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5RkFWe4omf4scx1xTZswuxVbK66hlQ0/view?usp=sharing', '', ''),

All small group of metals, called the Noble Metals, are much less reactive than others which results to the corrosion happening rarely. They are, in fact, the only metals that can be discovered in nature in their metallic state. The Noble Metals are often very valuable Some examples are copper, palladium, silver, platinum, and gold. Metals corrode because we use them in environments where they are chemically unstable. Only copper and the precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, etc.) are discovered in nature in their metallic state. All other metals, to include iron, the metal most commonly used, are processed from minerals or ores into metals which are inherently unstable in their environments. These metals are commonly used in making buildings and other materials that involve metals.

The researchers took this as an opportunity to make an exploratory study about the Aviation industry in the Philippines. The researchers chose this field to dwell on because it is aligned with the career path that they will take in the near future and also because they saw the importance of the aviation industry in the Philippines. The researchers interviewed 5 professionals that are currently working/worked for the Aviation industry. The inquisitors used purposive sampling and snowball sampling in contacting their respondents. The group of researchers went to Laguna and Pasay to gain information from the respondents and shared a little token as a gratitude for participating in the process of completing the research paper. Through the interviewees, they learned that Aviation requires fluidity. If one area of the system is not functioning well, then the whole industry crumbles. In addition they learned that the Aviation industry is currently improving in terms of ground services and there is an oversupply of graduates that would want to work under the said industry.

Joseph D. Lesada call this kind of phenomenon as ‘Code-Switching.’ In the study he conducted, he said that stating two or more languages in a single utterance is called ‘Code-Switching.’ Why it became a norm in the society? Well, he said that most of the parents teach their child/children English language first and as they grow up, they are obliged to learn Filipino as well. When they’re having a hard time explaining in Filipino, they’ll state the correlative in English and it became their practice even before they knew it. Lasada’s research explains why the respondents have hardships on Filipino becauwith others causing them to lack knowledge about other Filipino words especially when it’s a deep word. Because of this, people tend to ask for translations when they write Formal or Informal theme papers in Filipino but they don’t fully find it hard when they translate it on their own since a lot rated its difficulty as 3 out of 5 being the highest.

Besides this, we can see in the data that gender stereotypes are the most evident stereotype in the field of Engineering today and this has a negative and positive effect on the respondents. Not only the opinions of the people around them affect the decision of the students, but also the opinion of their parents in the course that they will take. The respondents also gave the factors that they take into consideration when it comes to the field that they will choose like interest, skills, income, and the length of study.

Recto', 2017, 'Science', 'The purpose of this research is to know the effect of calcium lactate in a chick’s weight and carbon dioxide production. It is to help other people who are finding supplements to increase their chick’s weight and likewise its carbon dioxide production. To find out the results, the researchers prepared 3 set-ups for the experimental group. All of the set – ups were fed with standard feed. Set up A was fed without the calcium lactate. Set up B was fed with 150mg of calcium lactate. While Set up C, on the other hand, was fed with 250mg of calcium lactate. The temperature of the area, the age of the chicks and the feeds and water that were consumed remained constant. The group fed the chicks twice a day. Set up B and C were fed with the supplement of calcium lactate on their feed and water in the morning. The researchers recorded the weight and the carbon dioxide levels of the chicks before the chicks were fed and after one week. The researchers have observed that Set Up B which feed contains 150mg of calcium lactate had the largest difference between its initial and final weight which is 50 grams. Set Up A which was only fed with the standard feed had 30g difference between its initial and final weight. While, Set Up C which feed contains 250mg of calcium lactate had 19g difference between its initial and final weight. The group also observed the carbon dioxide production of the chicks. It was found that, Set Up A had a difference of 16858ppm on its initial and final carbon dioxide production. While, Set Up B had a difference of 4166 ppm and Set C had a difference of 8235ppm on its initial and final carbon dioxide production. Based on the presented data, the group therefore concluded that the calcium lactate would cause a chick’s bone density increase which would result to an increase on the chick’s weight and too much intake of it will make the chick lose its appetite. Too much calcium lactate would also increase the carbon dioxide production resulting for the chick’s heartbeat to rise.', 'calcium lactate, chick, weight, carbon dioxide, bone density, biology, life, chicken, experiment, carbon dioxide, oxygen, science, animal', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNasTfnJw7LsbEVtbscjlrB0x89SIopr/view?usp=sharing', '', ''),

Therefore, a lot of Christians were either banished or killed. John was exiled to the island of Patmos. And there, he wrote the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation itself was composed as resistance literature to meet crisis. The book is then an exhortation and admonition to Christians of the first century to stand firm in the faith and to avoid compromise with paganism, despite the threat of adversity and martyrdom; they are to patiently await the fulfilment of God’s promises. It is therefore a type of narrative since it tells a story and describes the event of the destruction and soon the redemption of humanity. It is also an apocalyptic book since it serves as a warning to all inhabitants of the future. It can also be considered as a prophetic book for its resemblance to the prophetic book of Daniel, which also shows warnings of God. The story of the 7 trumpets depicts the disobedience of humankind to the will of God. This disobedience would result in severe punishment and destruction of His creation. The effects of the first six trumpets will include ecological disaster and because of this, many people will die. Though we think of this revelation as a punishment. We should look at it as a way of a warning or reminder for each one of us. God’s creation is one of His greatest gifts to humanity. He had also given us the gift of freedom. The gift to choose\r\nwhatever we want to do or pursue in life. Therefore, as beloved children of His, we must use this to be catalysts of change in our world. This is through influencing others to be responsible stewards of God’s creation as well. In the context of the original audience, God wanted to tell them that their disobedience would have grave punishment. In the time of John of Patmos, paganism and worshipping of other Gods are prevalent. Not only that, persecution of Christians became an order due to Domitian. And because of this, God became angered to them and took away all of His gifts. But amidst all of this, redemption is presented to us by God. God promised the coming of His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to bring glory and triumph to His Kingdom. This presents to us the eternal love of God to fulfil his promise of hope. In our present day context, God only tells us that we should follow His commands through obedience of the 10 Commandments. This can only be done by fostering love and avoiding worldly possessions.

This study may help students adjust to the distance learning environment and improve their academic performance. The group hypothesized that digital notes will have a better effect on memory retention compared to traditional hardcopy learning materials, and each note-taking method will yield different efficacies. The researchers conducted an experiment that compared E-Books to learning materials with different digital note-taking methods: Outline, Sentence, Charting, Mapping, Illustration, and Cornell.

It was mostly positive, and only a few students wanted to pursue non-medical fields. However, it was evident that the students still have their reservations about the expenses of pursuing medicine despite their determination to pursue it. Their reasons moved the overall result. Many students do not change their perception in the medical field despite the pandemic\'s presence and decisions. Moreover, students who do not want to pursue medicine consider factors that they are pondering on.  \r\n', 'pandemic, perception, STEM, students, high school students, medicine, medical professions, survey, thoughts, behavior, career, profession, doctor, choice, decisions, science, thinking, psychology, field, nurse, practitioners, pharmaceutical, hospitals, pursuit, job', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/14beqqsjZRsBEVWjI72-x8SbbkMk2BflL/view?usp=sharing', '2021-01-19 20:50:19', 'Posted!'),

The yearly research conducted by Theresians inspired the researchers to make an easier library management system for them. ILAW Database was created into a website through the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. \r\n\r\nThe perception of the students and teachers was compared through a survey with six categories: Navigation, Interface, Search Engine, Information, and Satisfaction that was rated 1-5. The group selected the respondents through Stratified Random Sampling. The students were grouped by year level while the teachers were grouped by their subject area. In statistical analysis, the T-test was used twice per category. The first t-test was utilized to compare the results that were gathered from Grade 11 and Grade 12 students. And, the second t-test was used to compare the perception of the students and the teachers. \r\n\r\nThe results showed that in all categories of the survey, there was no significant difference between the perception of Grade 11 and Grade 12 students as well as between the perception of the students and the teachers. It was also found that the majority of the respondents preferred a Digital Database System compared to a Manual Library Management System. And, 100% of the respondents think that the database will be useful for the STCQC Community. After examining the data, the researchers concluded that ILAW Database met the expectations of the STCQC Highschool Community and has shown no significant difference between the perception of the students and teachers regardless of their level of maturity and profession.

Laviste, K. Lee, A. Nastor, G. Tuazon', 2020, 'Quantitative Research', 'With the recent changes brought by COVID-19, students have shifted from face to face classes to distance learning. With this, 21st-century learners have the option to take digital notes. This study entitled “The Effects of Different Note-Taking Methods on Students’ Memory Retention” aimed to determine the best digital note-taking methods that aid the memory retention of Grade 11 STEM students in St. Theresa\\\'s College, Quezon City. This study may help students adjust to the distance learning environment and improve their academic performance. The group hypothesized that digital notes will have a better effect on memory retention compared to traditional hardcopy learning materials, and each note-taking method will yield different efficacies. The researchers conducted an experiment that compared E-Books to learning materials with different digital note-taking methods: Outline, Sentence, Charting, Mapping, Illustration, and Cornell. The researchers gathered 35 participants from the Grade 11 STEM Students and divided them into seven groups that correspond to the E-Book (control) and digital note-taking methods (experimental). A 15-minute pre-test was administered to measure the background knowledge of the students. After which, the participants were given 20 minutes to review the respective learning materials assigned to them before administering the 15-minute post-test. Then, the group collated and analyzed the results of the experiment by comparing the points of increase from each group that served as a measure of improvement in memory retention. With a critical value of 2.45 and an F-stat value of 2.5464, the group determined that there was a significant difference between the results from all groups. However, when a t-test was conducted, only the Outlining and Cornell Method obtained a significant difference when compared to the E-book, making the former the most effective and the latter least effective. The remaining digital notes were found to have the same efficacy as E-books. To conclude, the group rejected their hypothesis that claims that digital notes generally have a better effect on memory retention than traditional learning materials such as E-Books. The researchers specifically recommended the use of the Outlining Method since it was the only method that showed a significant improvement rate for memory retention.', 'education, note-taking, memory retention, education, learning, notes, students, brain, logic, intellect, intellectual, technology, digital,  Outline, Sentence, Charting, Mapping, Illustration, and Cornell, test, scores, grades, points, learners', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZ1umbX_YUVR7BjyNt86J5dv6YSKI5Hp/view?usp=sharing', '2021-01-20 11:48:52', 'Posted!'),

Pascual', 2020, 'Quantitative Research', 'This research study aims to investigate the impact of prolonged screen time on the sleeping habits of the respondents. Additionally, this study examined the external factors that compromised the sleeping hours and the enthusiasm level of the participants. An online questionnaire was distributed to the grade 12 STEM students of St. Theresa’s College Quezon City wherein 26% of the total population of the STEM strand equivalent to 20 students was randomly selected to participate. The questionnaire was administered for a week-long to monitor the behavior of the students. The T-test conducted showed that there was no significant difference on the average screen time and sleeping hours between STEM A and STEM B for both sections have similar experiences. The researchers found out that the majority of the respondents (56.6%) spent 7-9 hours of sleep for the week while the rest of the students exhibited sleep deprivation and oversleeping. Moreover, the screen time of the respondents ranged between 6-12 hours daily. Findings regarding the correlation between the average screen time and sleeping hours of the participants revealed a slight inverse relationship wherein as the screen time of the students increased, their sleeping hours were shortened. In addition, the correlation between the average sleeping hours and enthusiasm level of the students also demonstrated a slight relationship. As the students spend longer hours of sleep, their enthusiasm level increases. However, it was found that these were not applicable for all, as some exhibited unexpected practices such as not obtaining the ideal hours of sleep, but still manifested high levels of enthusiasm the next day due to the other external factors observed. Therefore, the researchers conclude that prolonged screen time impedes the ability of the STEM students in attaining the recommended sleeping hours. Furthermore, their daily activities and lifestyle also had an impact on their enthusiasm. The researchers strongly suggested that the STEM students should practice healthy sleeping habits and regulate their screen time for them to function at their full potential.', 'screen time, sleeping habits, technology, computer, eye strain, health, passive, active, behavior, hours, deprivation, oversleeping, hypersomnia, sleep insufficiency, sleeplessness', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QLI_d4wMTQPuu5PCJQx-CNFuVUhmzp4Y/view?usp=sharing', '2021-01-20 11:52:03', 'Posted!'),

Viray', 2020, 'Quantitative Research', 'Plastic pollution is one of the biggest adversaries the planet is yet to combat. Non-biodegradable plastics are used for only a short period of time but take several to even a hundred years to decompose. Therefore, bioplastics are considered to be an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastics. With this, the researchers decided to create a bioplastic with the casein of non-fat milk as its base and gelatin to act as an agent that may improve the bioplastic’s elasticity, biodegradability, tensile strength, and plasticity. However, the effectiveness, efficiency, and other characteristics of the created products will not be tested and discussed further because of the time restraints. \r\n\r\nThe group’s controlled setup will be the milk-based bioplastic and the experimental setups are those milk-based bioplastics with added gelatin. This will be tested for its elasticity, plasticity, and tensile strength by using weights with an interval of 25 grams that are hung on the bioplastic until it stretches and breaks. For each weight interval, its length will be measured. For biodegradability, its weight was measured before and after it was buried in a 5cm depth in the soil and its weight was also measured every day for 7 days. The group performed comparative statistical analysis and t-tests to analyze the data.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the research, the group concluded that the gelatin affected the tensile strength, elasticity, and biodegradability of the bioplastic differently. The tensile strength of the bioplastic increases with the amount of gelatin to be used. While the elasticity of the bioplastic is optimal at 15-20 grams of gelatin. \r\n\r\n	The statistical test used to further analyze the measurements obtained in the property of biodegradability is the T-test. Using the variables of the initial weight and the weight lost after seven days, the t-value computed was 0.01.\r\n\r\nThe remaining setups will be created by gradually increasing the amount of gelatin by 5 grams per setup until the desired output is achieved. The main components of the bioplastic are milk, vinegar, and gelatin. Other materials for the procedure, including a strainer, cloth, and heating equipment, will be used. Vinegar will be used to separate the casein from the milk. The casein will be mixed with vinegar and gelatin in a pan on low heat. After spreading the mixture on a foil, it was left for at least 3 days to dry. \r\n', 'environment, bioplastic, compostable, biodegradable', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e9Jb6D6ZhDaV4DJxEIJbO0z5qHD6OEcP/view?usp=sharing', '2021-01-21 17:08:46', 'Posted!'),
